\begin{defn}
  There is a one-to-one correspondence between the class $Q$ of all
  probability measures equivalent to $P$ and the class $\Lambda$ of
  all $F$-adapted (or $F$ predicatable) processes $\lambda_{t}$
  satisfying
  \begin{equation}
    P \left(\int_{0}^{T^{*}} |\lambda_{u}|^{2} \left(\int_{0}^{\cdot}
        \lambda_{u} dW_{u} \right) \right) = 1
  \end{equation}
  and the set of all probability measures on $R^{n}$.
\end{defn}


\begin{thm}
  There is a one-to-one correspondence between $Q$ and $P$. 
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}[From Harshorne]
  This follows as a corollary to 14.2.  In general, this is a simple
  result that follows naturally from the text.

\end{proof}

\subsection{Stochasticity}

This follows as a simple corollary from the initial text.
