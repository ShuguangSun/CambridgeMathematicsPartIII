# Cambridge Part III Notes #

Lecture notes from Cambridge Part III.  Mostly statistics/applied
mathematics courses.

## Summaries

The summaries are intended for exam revision, and contain all major
theorems and lemmas given in the course, along with brief outlines of
the proofs of these results. Special care is taken to make the proofs
detailed enough to replicate the required result, without being an
exhaustively detailed recreation of the lecture notes.
