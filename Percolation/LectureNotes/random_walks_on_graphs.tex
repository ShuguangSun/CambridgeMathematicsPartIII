\label{cha:random-walks-graphs}

Our basic setting is the (hyper-)cubic lattice on $\R^{d}, d \geq 1$.
This is the graph with vertex set $\Z^{d}$, edges $\IP{x, y} \iff \| x
- y \|_{1} = 1$, and edge set denoted $E^{d}$.  A lattice is $L^{d} =
(\Z^{d}, E^{d})$.

\section{Percolation}
\label{sec:percolation}

Let $0 < p < 1$. Let $e \in E^{d}$, and with probability $p$
independently for each edge, declare $e$ to be \textbf{open} else
\textbf{closed}. Consider $x \leftrightarrow y$ if there exists an
open path from $x$ to $y$. The \textbf{open cluster} at $x$ is $C_{x}
= \{ y: x \leftrightarrow y \}$.

\begin{boxthm}
  For a given $p$, what can be said about the $C_{x}$?
\end{boxthm}

For $p = 1$, $C_{x} = Z_{d}$.  For $p = 0$, $C_{x} = \{ x \}$.

\begin{defn}[Percolation probability]
  \label{defn:random_walks_on_graphs:1}
  Let $\theta(p) = \Prob{|C_{\theta}|} = \Prob_{p}$. Note that
  $\theta$ is non-decreasing.

  Let $p_{c} = \sup \{ p : \theta(p) = 0 \}$.

  It is known that $\theta$ is $C^{\infty}$ on $(p_{c}, 1]$, and that
  $\theta$ is right-continuous on $[0, 1]$.

  It is believed that $\theta$ is concave on $(p_{c}, 1]$, and that
  $\theta$ is real-analytic on $(p_{c}, 1]$, and that $\theta(p_{c}) =
  0$ (known for $d = 2$, and $d \geq 16$).
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
  \label{defn:random_walks_on_graphs:2}
  Probability theorey.  Let $\Omega = \{ 0, 1\}^{E^{d}}$,
  $\mathcal{F}$ be the $\sigma$-filed generated by the
  finite-dimensional cylinder ... of form .
  $\{ \omega \in \Omega: \omega = \text{$\xi$ on $\mathcal{F}$}\} =
  E_{F}(\xi)$.

\begin{thm}
  \label{defn:random_walks_on_graphs:3}
  For $d \geq 2$, $0 < p_{c} < 1$.
\end{thm}
